# Three keys to code

English | [简体中文](README.md)

Programming with only three keys!

## Game rules

1. You can choose three "letters or numbers" to write codes. The "letters or numbers" in the code **can only and must** have these three. These three "letters or numbers" must be used in the code, and only these three "letters or numbers" can be used.
2. In addition to these three "letters/numbers", all ASCII symbols on a normal keyboard are additionally allowed (such as `{`, `;`, etc.)
3. After the program runs, it outputs `Hello, World!`, there is and only this content, the requirements are exactly the same, pay attention to capitalization and symbols
4. The one with the smallest size of all uploaded files wins! (Result screenshots, documentation, etc. are not counted)
5. Not limited to programming languages, but the use of very niche languages is prohibited; our definition of very niche is: [Github language statistics](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2022/1) language never seen before
6. All dependencies must be existing before the competition starts; otherwise, please upload it as part of the file content statistics!
7. It is required to use mediocre compile/execution commands, test environments, and file names. Except for the mediocre parts, the rest also need to meet the requirements of 1 and 2 above.

## Ranking

Please reference to [排名](README.md#排名)

## How to participate

- Join this Github organization or submit code by Pull Request.
- Everyone builds a folder and puts the code, README, screenshots, etc. in it.
- Modify the above [Ranking](README.md#排名), fill in your own results and what you want to say.

## Prizes

Sorry, I can't mail you the prizes if you don't live in mainland China.

## FAQ

### Can some operations be performed through compilation parameters?

Please refer to the competition rules:

> 7. It is required to use mediocre compile/execution commands, test environments, and file names. Except for the mediocre parts, the rest also need to meet the requirements of 1 and 2 above.

So it's almost impossible, but it's ok if you can follow the rules exactly.

### Can I request the network?

Please refer to the competition rules:

> 3. After the program runs, it outputs `Hello, World!`, there is and only this content, it is required to be exactly the same, pay attention to capitalization and symbols
> 6. All dependencies must be existing before the competition starts; otherwise, please upload it as part of the file content statistics!
> 7. It is required to use mediocre compile/execution commands, test environments, and file names. Except for the mediocre parts, the rest also need to meet the requirements of 1 and 2 above.

Also almost infeasible, but ok if you can follow the rules exactly.

### Are compiled languages ​​(especially C/C++) dead?

Seems like yes, we're also thinking about how to make a way for compiled languages ​​to come in without drastically changing the rules, but there's no good idea yet.  
If you have a good idea, please tell us!

### HTML, Brainfuck can participate?

Can NOT.

- HTML is not even a programming language, it never appeared in [Github Language Statistics](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2022/1)
- Brainfuck didn't show up either, and even if it was allowed, it wouldn't fit the rules of the game:
  > Contestants choose three "letters/numbers" to write the code, the "letters/numbers" in the code **can only and must** have these three

### I'm using a niche language that has appeared in previous Github language stats, but not in the latest quarterly stats, okay?

Yes, as long as it appears in any period.

> 5. Unlimited programming languages, but the use of very niche languages ​​is prohibited; our definition of very niche is: [Github language statistics](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2022/1 ) that never appeared on

This rule is set up to prevent the competition from becoming a "minority language discovery competition that can directly output HelloWorld" or a "self-created language competition", not to impose too many restrictions on everyone.

### Why can't I clone this project normally?

Previously, some contestants uploaded some file names, which caused the clone to fail under Windows. Please add the `--depth=1` parameter and try again

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InvoluteHell/ThreeKeysProgramming.git --depth=1
